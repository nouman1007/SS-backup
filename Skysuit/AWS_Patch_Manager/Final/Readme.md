# Patch Management Using Systems Manager

The designed solution involves setting up the patch automation solution in each AWS account through AWS CloudFormation StackSets in a Master account, and configuring a resource data sync across the accounts with the Master account.  To extract value quickly from resource data sync(SSM Inventory), query the underlying data source using Amazon Athena.

## **AWS Services Used In Solution**

- AWS  resource data sync. 

- AWS S3 - to keep reports.

- AWS Glue Crawler - it runs periodically, scans the data and automatically populate the AWS Glue Data Catalog.

- AWS Glue Data Catalog - once data in Glue Data Catalog, it readily available to querying in Athena. 

- AWS Athena DataBase.

- AWS CloudFormation Template - to automate the solution.

- AWS QuickSight - to visualize the reports.

## Solution Design

## Deployment



1. In the master account, an AWS CloudFormation stack set is used to configure the S3 bucket for resource data sync through Systems Manager Inventory.

2. The CloudFormation stack set creates the stack with  the patch baselines, and sets up Systems Manager Inventory resource data sync on the application accounts, to synchronize resources in the shared services account.

3. The resource information in the application accounts is synchronized with the resource information in the shared services account.

4. Amazon QuickSight generates patch compliance reports, using the Amazon Athena dataset for the synchronized resource information.
